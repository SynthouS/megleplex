# megleplex
A mind-bending visualization of the Megleplex number - where each "layer" equals one Googolplex

## Concept

The Megleplex is defined as:
- **1 Googolplex** = 10^(10^100) = 1 followed by 10100 zeros
- **1 Megleplex** = 1 followed by 10^(10^100) zeros, **repeated 1000 times**

This project attempts to symbolically represent this unimaginably large number through progressive generation.

## Math Definition

The number follows this formal definition:
Megleplex = 10^(10^(10^100)) Ã— 1000
